<p>Get all transactions in blocks since block [blockhash], or all transactions if omitted.</p>
<p>If &quot;blockhash&quot; is no longer a part of the main chain, transactions from the fork point onward are included.</p>
<p>Additionally, if include_removed is set, transactions affecting the wallet which were removed are returned in the &quot;removed&quot; array.</p>
<div class="section" id="argument-1-blockhash">
<h1>Argument #1 - blockhash</h1>
<p><strong>Type:</strong> string, optional</p>
<p>If set, the block hash to list transactions since, otherwise list all transactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="argument-2-target-confirmations">
<h1>Argument #2 - target_confirmations</h1>
<p><strong>Type:</strong> numeric, optional, default=1</p>
<p>Return the nth block hash from the main chain. e.g. 1 would mean the best block hash. Note: this is not used as a filter, but only affects [lastblock] in the return value</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="argument-3-include-watchonly">
<h1>Argument #3 - include_watchonly</h1>
<p><strong>Type:</strong> boolean, optional, default=true for watch-only wallets, otherwise false</p>
<p>Include transactions to watch-only addresses (see 'importaddress')</p>

      &quot;comment&quot; : &quot;str&quot;,                   (string) If a comment is associated with the transaction, only present if not empty.
      &quot;bip125-replaceable&quot; : &quot;str&quot;,        (string) (&quot;yes|no|unknown&quot;) Whether this transaction could be replaced due to BIP125 (replace-by-fee);

  ],
  &quot;lastblock&quot; : &quot;hex&quot;                      (string) The hash of the block (target_confirmations-1) from the best block on the main chain, or the genesis hash if the referenced block does not exist yet. This is typically used to feed back into listsinceblock the next time you call it. So you would generally use a target_confirmations of say 6, so you will be continually re-notified of transactions until they've reached 6 confirmations plus any new ones
